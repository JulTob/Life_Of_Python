# Replace the first occurrence of marker in the line below.
# There will be at least one occurrence of the marker in the
# line of text. Put the answer in the variable 'replaced'.
# Hint: You can find out the length of a string by command
# len(string). We might test your code with different markers!

# Example 1
marker = "AFK"
replacement = "away from keyboard"
line = "I will now go to sleep and be AFK until lunch time tomorrow."

# Example 2 # uncomment this to test with different input
#marker = "EY"
#replacement = "Eyjafjallajokull"
#line = "The eruption of the volcano EY in 2010 disrupted air travel in Europe for 6 days."

index=0
index=line.find(marker,index)


replaced = line[:index] + replacement + line [index+len(marker):]

print replaced
